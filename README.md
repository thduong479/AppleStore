# AppleStore

In today's mobile-centric world, app visibility and user engagement are critical. To excel in this competitive space, understanding mobile app analytics is important for growth and retention. This project utilizes a dataset of more than 7000 Apple iOS mobile apps, extracted from the iTunes Search API in July 2017. This dataset offers valuable insights into what drives apps to the top of the iOS app store charts. 

In this project, I have used a dataset from Kaggle:

## Questions to be explored
1. Do paid apps have higher ratings than free apps?
2. Do apps with more supported languages have higher ratings?
3. Which genres have low ratings?
4. Is there any correlation between the length of the app description?
5. What are the top-rated apps for each genre?

## Analysis Steps
1. **Step 1:** Import data (.csv files) into SQL Sever
2. **Step 2:** Exploring Data
3. **Step 3:** Data Analysis 

## Finding the insights
The analysis conducted has produced several insights:

1. The data analysis reveals that paid apps tend to receive slightly higher ratings compared to their free counterparts. This may be attributed to various factors, such as users who invest in an app showing higher engagement and perceiving greater value, leading to improved ratings. Therefore, we can advise the client that if they believe in the quality of their apps, they should consider introducing a reasonable price for them.
2. The analysis indicates that apps supporting a moderate number of languages, specifically between 10 and 30, achieve the highest average ratings. This suggests that the key to success isn't merely the number of supported languages but rather the selection of the right languages that align with the app's purpose.
3. Certain categories like finance and books show lower user ratings for existing apps, indicating that user needs might not be adequately met in these areas. This presents a valuable market opportunity. By creating high-quality apps in these categories that better cater to user needs, there is potential for both high user satisfaction and market penetration.
4. App description length exhibits a positive correlation with user ratings. This suggests that users value a comprehensive and well-crafted app description, as it provides them with a clear understanding of the app's features and capabilities before downloading. A detailed description can set expectations and ultimately enhance user satisfaction.
5. The average user rating across all apps is 3.5. To distinguish the apps in a competitive market, the client should aim for ratings higher than this average of 3.5.
6. Categories like games and entertainment have a high number of apps, indicating a potentially saturated market. Entering these sectors may pose challenges due to high competition. However, it's worth noting that there is also a considerable demand from users in these categories.
